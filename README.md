### Hacktoberfest 2023

This repo is very much in alpha stage. So anyone can contribute fixing things here and there. It will be valuable for repo.
Things to consider before contributing.  
1. There are no hard rules for contributing you can fix 1 line of code or many, just remember it should add value to project.
2. We are using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and a very simple layout (looks of website). And Typescript.
3. Use [link here]() to download and add shadcn/ui components. Also npx package manager will work `npx shadcn-ui@latest init` and then `npx shadcn-ui@latest add {component}`
4. Also using `pnpm` as package manager. I know there is `bun` hype. We can discuss it in discussions.
